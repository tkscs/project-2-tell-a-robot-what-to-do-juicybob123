Overall Rough Draft Score: 50 / 50
 
Basic Functionality (15 points):

* [ 10 / 10 ] Robot can move, and code runs without errors in simulator
* [ 5 / 5 ] Robot does not crash into walls

Control Flow - If/Elif/Else (15 points):

** Make sure to use `elif` and `else` if there's only one path you want the code to follow!**

* [ 0 / 5 ] At least one if/elif/else chain with 3+ branches
* [ 4 / 5 ] At least one if/else that checks a sonar sensor reading
* [ 4 / 5 ] At least one if/else that checks user input

User Input (15 points):

* [ 3 / 3 ] At least 3 different input() prompts
* [ 6 / 6 ] At least 6 different user responses are handled (2 per prompt above)
* [ 6 / 6 ] Robot behavior changes based on user input at least 6 times (each response above corresponds to a different behavior)

Functions (10 points):

* [ 3 / 3 ] Define at least 3 functions
* [ 3 / 3 ] Call each of your functions at least once
* [ 0 / 3 ] For each function, include a doc string explaining the API
* [ 0 / 1 ] At least 1 of your functions has at least 1 parameter

Sensors (10 points):

* [ 0 / 5 ] Read a sonar distance at least 5 times
* [ 0 / 5 ] Robot behavior changes based on the sonar values

Loops/Recursion (15 points):

* [ 10 / 10 ] Implements indefinite execution using at least one while loop OR at least one recursive function call
* [ 0 / 5 ] There is an option to terminate your indefinite execution
